Usage: turnserver [options]
Options:
 -d, --listening-device	<device-name>		Listener interface device (NOT RECOMMENDED. Optional, Linux only).
 -p, --listening-port		<port>		TURN listener port (Default: 3478).
						Note: actually, TLS & DTLS sessions can connect to the "plain" TCP & UDP port(s), too,
						if allowed by configuration.
 --tls-listening-port		<port>		TURN listener port for TLS & DTLS listeners
						(Default: 5349).
						Note: actually, "plain" TCP & UDP sessions can connect to the TLS & DTLS port(s), too,
						if allowed by configuration. The TURN server
						"automatically" recognizes the type of traffic. Actually, two listening
						endpoints (the "plain" one and the "tls" one) are equivalent in terms of
						functionality; but we keep both endpoints to satisfy the RFC 5766 specs.
						For secure TCP connections, we currently support SSL version 3 and
						TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. For secure UDP connections, we support
						DTLS version 1.
 --alt-listening-port<port>	<port>		Alternative listening port for STUN CHANGE_REQUEST (in RFC 5780 sense, 
                                                or in old RFC 3489 sense, default is "listening port plus one").
 --alt-tls-listening-port	<port>		Alternative listening port for TLS and DTLS,
 						the default is "TLS/DTLS port plus one".
 --tcp-proxy-port		<port>		Support connections from TCP loadbalancer on this port. The loadbalancer should
						use the binary proxy protocol (https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt)
 -L, --listening-ip		<ip>		Listener IP address of relay server. Multiple listeners can be specified.
 --aux-server			<ip:port>	Auxiliary STUN/TURN server listening endpoint.
						Auxiliary servers do not have alternative ports and
						they do not support RFC 5780 functionality (CHANGE REQUEST).
						Valid formats are 1.2.3.4:5555 for IPv4 and [1:2::3:4]:5555 for IPv6.
 --udp-self-balance				(recommended for older Linuxes only) Automatically balance UDP traffic
						over auxiliary servers (if configured).
						The load balancing is using the ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism.
						The TURN client must support 300 ALTERNATE-SERVER response for this functionality.
 -i, --relay-device		<device-name>	Relay interface device for relay sockets (NOT RECOMMENDED. Optional, Linux only).
 -E, --relay-ip		<ip>			Relay address (the local IP address that will be used to relay the
						packets to the peer).
						Multiple relay addresses may be used.
						The same IP(s) can be used as both listening IP(s) and relay IP(s).
						If no relay IP(s) specified, then the turnserver will apply the default
						policy: it will decide itself which relay addresses to be used, and it
						will always be using the client socket IP address as the relay IP address
						of the TURN session (if the requested relay address family is the same
						as the family of the client socket).
 -X, --external-ip  <public-ip[/private-ip]>	TURN Server public/private address mapping, if the server is behind NAT.
						In that situation, if a -X is used in form "-X ip" then that ip will be reported
						as relay IP address of all allocations. This scenario works only in a simple case
						when one single relay address is be used, and no STUN CHANGE_REQUEST
						functionality is required.
						That single relay address must be mapped by NAT to the 'external' IP.
						For that 'external' IP, NAT must forward ports directly (relayed port 12345
						must be always mapped to the same 'external' port 12345).
						In more complex case when more than one IP address is involved,
						that option must be used several times in the command line, each entry must
						have form "-X public-ip/private-ip", to map all involved addresses.
 --allow-loopback-peers				Allow peers on the loopback addresses (127.x.x.x and ::1).
 --no-multicast-peers				Disallow peers on well-known broadcast addresses (224.0.0.0 and above, and FFXX:*).
 -m, --relay-threads		<number>	Number of relay threads to handle the established connections
						(in addition to authentication thread and the listener thread).
						If explicitly set to 0 then application runs in single-threaded mode.
						If not set then a default OS-dependent optimal algorithm will be employed.
						The default thread number is the number of CPUs.
						In older systems (pre-Linux 3.9) the number of UDP relay threads always equals
						the number of listening endpoints (unless -m 0 is set).
 --min-port			<port>		Lower bound of the UDP port range for relay endpoints allocation.
						Default value is 49152, according to RFC 5766.
 --max-port			<port>		Upper bound of the UDP port range for relay endpoints allocation.
						Default value is 65535, according to RFC 5766.
 -v, --verbose					'Moderate' verbose mode.
 -V, --Verbose					Extra verbose mode, very annoying (for debug purposes only).
 -o, --daemon					Start process as daemon (detach from current shell).
 --no-software-attribute	 		Production mode: hide the software version (formerly --prod).
 -f, --fingerprint				Use fingerprints in the TURN messages.
 -a, --lt-cred-mech				Use the long-term credential mechanism.
 -z, --no-auth					Do not use any credential mechanism, allow anonymous access.
 -u, --user			<user:pwd>	User account, in form 'username:password', for long-term credentials.
						Cannot be used with TURN REST API.
 -r, --realm			<realm>		The default realm to be used for the users when no explicit
						origin/realm relationship was found in the database.
						Must be used with long-term credentials 
						mechanism or with TURN REST API.
 --check-origin-consistency			The flag that sets the origin consistency check:
						across the session, all requests must have the same
						main ORIGIN attribute value (if the ORIGIN was
						initially used by the session).
 -q, --user-quota		<number>	Per-user allocation quota: how many concurrent allocations a user can create.
						This option can also be set through the database, for a particular realm.
 -Q, --total-quota		<number>	Total allocations quota: global limit on concurrent allocations.
						This option can also be set through the database, for a particular realm.
 -s, --max-bps			<number>	Default max bytes-per-second bandwidth a TURN session is allowed to handle
						(input and output network streams are treated separately). Anything above
						that limit will be dropped or temporary suppressed
						(within the available buffer limits).
						This option can also be set through the database, for a particular realm.
 -B, --bps-capacity		<number>	Maximum server capacity.
						Total bytes-per-second bandwidth the TURN server is allowed to allocate
						for the sessions, combined (input and output network streams are treated separately).

 --secret-key-file	<filename>		This is the file path which contain secret key of aes encryption while using MySQL password encryption.
						If you want to use in the MySQL connection string the password in encrypted format,
						then set in this option the file path of the secret key. The key which is used to encrypt MySQL password.
						Warning: If this option is set, then MySQL password must be set in "mysql-userdb" option in encrypted format!
						If you want to use cleartext password then do not set this option!
 -N, --redis-userdb	<connection-string>	Redis user database connection string, if used (default - empty, no Redis DB used).
	                                	This database can be used for long-term credentials mechanism users,

						(default - empty, no Redis stats DB used).
	                                	This database keeps allocations status information, and it can be also used for publishing
		                                and delivering traffic and allocation event notifications.
						The connection string has the same parameters as redis-userdb connection string.
 --use-auth-secret				TURN REST API flag.
						Flag that sets a special authorization option that is based upon authentication secret
						(TURN Server REST API, see TURNServerRESTAPI.pdf). This option is used with timestamp.
 --static-auth-secret		<secret>	'Static' authentication secret value (a string) for TURN REST API only.
						If not set, then the turn server will try to use the 'dynamic' value
						in turn_secret table in user database (if present).
						That database value can be changed on-the-fly
						by a separate program, so this is why it is 'dynamic'.
						Multiple shared secrets can be used (both in the database and in the "static" fashion).
 --no-auth-pings				Disable periodic health checks to 'dynamic' auth secret tables.
 --no-dynamic-ip-list				Do not use dynamic allowed/denied peer ip list.

 -l, --log-file		<filename>		Option to set the full path name of the log file.
						By default, the turnserver tries to open a log file in
						/var/log/turnserver/, /var/log, /var/tmp, /tmp and . (current) directories
						(which open operation succeeds first that file will be used).
						With this option you can set the definite log file name.
						The special names are "stdout" and "-" - they will force everything
						to the stdout; and "syslog" name will force all output to the syslog.
 --no-stdout-log				Flag to prevent stdout log messages.
						By default, all log messages are going to both stdout and to
						a log file. With this option everything will be going to the log file only
						(unless the log file itself is stdout).
 --syslog					Output all log information into the system log (syslog), do not use the file output.
 --simple-log					This flag means that no log file rollover will be used, and the log file
						name will be constructed as-is, without PID and date appendage.
						This option can be used, for example, together with the logrotate tool.

     --no-stun					Option to suppress STUN functionality, only TURN requests will be processed.
 --alternate-server		<ip:port>	Set the TURN server to redirect the allocate requests (UDP and TCP services).
						Multiple alternate-server options can be set for load balancing purposes.
						See the docs for more information.
 --tls-alternate-server	<ip:port>		Set the TURN server to redirect the allocate requests (DTLS and TLS services).
						Multiple alternate-server options can be set for load balancing purposes.

						After the initialization, the turnserver process
						will make an attempt to change the current user ID to that user.
 --proc-group <group-name>			Group name to run the turnserver process.
						After the initialization, the turnserver process
						will make an attempt to change the current group ID to that group.
 --mobility					Mobility with ICE (MICE) specs support.
 -K, --keep-address-family			TURN server allocates address family according TURN
						Client <=> Server communication address family. 
						!! It breaks RFC6156 section-4.2 (violates default IPv4) !!
 --no-cli					Turn OFF the CLI support. By default it is always ON.
 --cli-ip=<IP>					Local system IP address to be used for CLI server endpoint. Default value
						is 127.0.0.1.
 --cli-port=<port>				CLI server port. Default is 5766.
 --cli-password=<password>			CLI access password. Default is empty (no password).

 --server-relay					Server relay. NON-STANDARD AND DANGEROUS OPTION. Only for those applications
						when we want to run server applications on the relay endpoints.
						This option eliminates the IP permissions check on the packets
						incoming to the relay endpoints.
 --cli-max-output-sessions			Maximum number of output sessions in ps CLI command.
						This value can be changed on-the-fly in CLI. The default value is 256.
